From the dataset above we can check that Cell_geo as the following columns. 

The CDR datasets have similar shapes.

 
3.0 Data Preparation 

We shall select the data into our Python environment i.e Google Colab using the Pandas LIbrary.
We shall be removing NULL from Cells_geo dataset.
Renaming the three CDR datasets i.e CDR 20120507,CDR 20120508 and CDR 20120509 columns to be common to enable easy merging.
Combining the above three CDR datasets respectively. 
Dropping Unnecessary columns from the combined CDR dataset.
Splitting the Date_Time column from the combined CDR dataset to create two columns of DATE and TIME respectively and dropping the redundant DATE_TIME column
Merging the Cell_geo data with the combined CDR dataset
Grouping product by time
